        <h2>Meet Ahfy — Always Here For You</h2>
        <p>
          We created <span class="highlight">Ahfy</span> with one simple belief:
          <em
            >everyone deserves a safe space to feel, understand, and express
            their emotions.</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Ahfy isn't just an app — it's your
          <span class="highlight">emotional support buddy</span>, embodied by a
          gentle fox named <strong>Ahfy</strong>, who guides you through moments
          of overwhelm, confusion, or emotional disconnection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Designed with the help of
          <span class="highlight">licensed therapists</span>, Ahfy combines the
          science of emotional regulation with the warmth of genuine human
          understanding.

      <!-- What Ahfy Does Section -->
      <div class="content-section">
        <h2><span class="emoji">🧠</span>What Ahfy Does</h2>
        <p>Ahfy helps you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Identify: what you're feeling and why.</li>
          <li>
            Understand: the underlying need or trigger behind the emotion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regulate: your emotions through tailored exercises — from guided
            journaling and somatic releases to mindfulness and breathing
            techniques.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each journey with Ahfy is personalized. When you tell Ahfy what's
          going on, the app gently guides you toward therapist-approved
          exercises that help you <em>process</em> instead of suppress.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="emoji">🌱</span>Why We Built Ahfy</h2>
        <p>
          In a world where mental health often feels complicated or clinical, we
          wanted to create something that feels
          <span class="highlight">safe, simple, and kind</span> — a companion
          that meets you where you are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ahfy was born from the intersection of
          <strong>psychology, technology, and empathy</strong> — to make
          emotional wellness
          <span class="highlight">accessible to everyone</span>, not just those
          in therapy rooms.
